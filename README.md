## Project Overview

This project provides a simple Terraform deployment of [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) into Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) platforms on AWS. It aims to be pre-configured with defaults that will allow most users to quickly get started with LiteLLM.

It also provides additional features on top of LiteLLM such as an AWS Bedrock Interface (instead of the default OpenAI interface), support for AWS Bedrock Managed Prompts, Chat History, and support for Okta Oauth 2.0 JWT Token Auth.

If you are unfamiliar with LiteLLM, it provides a consistent interface to access all LLM providers so you do not need to edit your code to try out different models. It allows you to centrally manage and track LLM usage across your company at the user, team, and api key level. You can configure budgets and rate limits, restrict access to specific models, and set up retry/fallback routing logic across multiple providers. It provides cost saving measures like prompt caching. It provides security features like support for AWS Bedrock Guardrails for all LLM providers. Finally, it provides a UI where administrators can configure their users and teams, and users can generate their api keys and test out different LLMs in a chat interface.

## Architecture

![Reference Architecture Diagram ECS EKS](./media/Gateway-Architecture-with-CloudFront.png)

### Architecture steps

1. Tenants and client applications access the LiteLLM gateway proxy API through the [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) URL endpoint or [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) distribution, which is protected against common web exploits and bots using [AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/).
2. AWS WAF forwards requests to [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/)to automatically distribute incoming application traffic to [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) tasks or [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) pods running generative AI gateway containers. TLS/SSL encryption secures traffic using a certificate issued by [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/).
3. Container images for API/middleware and LiteLLM applications are built during guidance deployment and pushed to [Amazon Elastic Container registry (ECR)](http://aws.amazon.com/ecr/). They are used for deployment to Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate or Amazon EKS clusters that run these applications as containers in ECS tasks or EKS pods, respectively. LiteLLM provides a unified application interface for configuration and interacting with LLM providers. The API/middleware integrates natively with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to enable features not supported by the [LiteLLM Open source project](https://docs.litellm.ai/).
4. Models hosted on [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and [Amazon Nova](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/) provide model access, guardrails, prompt caching, and routing to enhance the AI gateway and additional controls for clients through a unified API. Model access is also available for models deployed on [Amazon SageMaker AI](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/). [Access to required Amazon Bedrock models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) must be properly configured. 
5. External model providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Vertex AI) are configured using the LiteLLM Admin UI to enable additional model access through LiteLLMâ€™s unified application interface. Integrate pre-existing configurations of third-party providers into the gateway using LiteLLM APIs. 
6. LiteLLM integrates with [Amazon ElastiCache (Redis OSS)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), [Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), and [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) services. Amazon ElastiCache enables multi-tenant distribution of application settings and prompt caching. Amazon RDS enables persistence of virtual API keys and other configuration settings provided by LiteLLM. Secrets Manager stores external model provider credentials and other sensitive settings securely.
7. LiteLLM and the API/middleware store application sends logs to the dedicated [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) storage bucket for troubleshooting and access analysis. 

## Distribution Options

Starting with version 1.1.0, this solution supports flexible deployment scenarios to meet various security and accessibility requirements. You can customize how your LiteLLM gateway is accessed based on your specific needs.

### Deployment Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Default - Public with CloudFront (Recommended)
```bash
USE_CLOUDFRONT="true"
USE_ROUTE53="false"
PUBLIC_LOAD_BALANCER="true"
```

**Why choose this scenario:**
- Global performance with low-latency access via CloudFront's edge locations
- Enhanced security with AWS Shield Standard DDoS protection
- Simplified HTTPS management with CloudFront's default certificate
- Best option for public-facing AI services with global user base

**Security:**
- CloudFront IP filtering restricts ALB access to only CloudFront traffic
- WAF can be applied at the CloudFront level (requires global WAF)
- Simpler certificate management using CloudFront's default certificate

**Access URL:** `https://d1234abcdef.cloudfront.net`

#### Scenario 2: Custom Domain with CloudFront
```bash
USE_CLOUDFRONT="true"
USE_ROUTE53="true"
PUBLIC_LOAD_BALANCER="true"
HOSTED_ZONE_NAME="example.com"
RECORD_NAME="genai"
CERTIFICATE_ARN="arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/certificate-id"
```

**Why choose this scenario:**
- Brand consistency with your custom domain
- Professional appearance and SEO benefits
- Same global performance and security as Scenario 1

**Additional requirements:**
- Route53 hosted zone for your domain
- ACM certificate for your domain (must be in us-east-1 for CloudFront)

**Access URL:** `https://genai.example.com`

#### Scenario 3: Direct ALB Access (No CloudFront)
```bash
USE_CLOUDFRONT="false"
USE_ROUTE53="true"
PUBLIC_LOAD_BALANCER="true"
HOSTED_ZONE_NAME="example.com"
RECORD_NAME="genai"
CERTIFICATE_ARN="arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/certificate-id"
```

**Why choose this scenario:**
- Lower latency for single-region deployments
- Simplified architecture without CloudFront 
- Regional WAF can be directly applied to the ALB
- Cost savings by eliminating CloudFront distribution

**Security considerations:**
- No CloudFront layer means direct internet exposure of ALB
- WAF protection becomes particularly important
- ALB security group allows traffic from all IPs (0.0.0.0/0)

**Access URL:** `https://genai.example.com` (points directly to ALB)

#### Scenario 4: Private VPC Only
```bash
USE_CLOUDFRONT="false"
USE_ROUTE53="true"
PUBLIC_LOAD_BALANCER="false"
HOSTED_ZONE_NAME="example.internal"  # Often a private .internal domain
RECORD_NAME="genai"
CERTIFICATE_ARN="arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/certificate-id"
```

**Why choose this scenario:**
- Maximum security for internal enterprise applications
- Complete isolation from public internet
- Suitable for processing sensitive or proprietary data

**Access methods:**
- VPN connection to the VPC
- AWS Direct Connect
- VPC peering with corporate network
- Transit Gateway

**Security considerations:**
- No public internet access possible
- ALB security group only allows traffic from private subnet CIDRs
- Requires network connectivity to the VPC for access

**Access URL:** `https://genai.example.internal` (resolves only within VPC or connected networks)

### Configuration Quick Reference

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `USE_CLOUDFRONT` | `true` | Enables CloudFront distribution for global delivery |
| `USE_ROUTE53` | `false` | Enables Route53 for custom domain support |
| `PUBLIC_LOAD_BALANCER` | `true` | Deploys ALB in public subnets |
| `CLOUDFRONT_PRICE_CLASS` | `PriceClass_100` | CloudFront price class (100/200/All) |
| `HOSTED_ZONE_NAME` | `""` | Route53 hosted zone name for custom domain |
| `RECORD_NAME` | `""` | Record to create in Route53 (subdomain) |
| `CERTIFICATE_ARN` | `""` | ARN of ACM certificate for custom domain |

### Security Considerations

Each deployment scenario offers different security characteristics:

1. **CloudFront with public ALB (Default)**: 
   - ALB is in public subnets but protected by custom header authentication
   - Only traffic with the proper CloudFront secret header is allowed (except health check paths)
   - CloudFront provides an additional security layer with AWS Shield Standard DDoS protection
   - Best balance of accessibility and security for public services

2. **Direct ALB access (No CloudFront)**:
   - ALB directly accessible from internet
   - WAF protection is crucial for this deployment
   - Consider IP-based restrictions if possible

3. **Private VPC deployment**:
   - Highest security, no direct internet exposure
   - Requires VPN or Direct Connect for access
   - Consider for sensitive workloads or internal services

All scenarios maintain security best practices including:
- HTTPS for all communications with TLS 1.2+ 
- Security groups with principle of least privilege
- WAF protection against common attacks
- IAM roles with appropriate permissions

### CloudFront Authentication

When using CloudFront, a custom security mechanism is implemented:

1. CloudFront adds a secret header (`X-CloudFront-Secret`) to all requests sent to the ALB
2. The ALB has listener rules that verify this header before allowing access
3. Health check paths are specifically exempted to allow CloudFront origin health checks
4. The secret is stable across deployments (won't change unless explicitly changed)

This provides a robust defense against direct ALB access even if someone discovers your ALB's domain name. The secret is only displayed once after creation in the Terraform outputs and is marked as sensitive.

## Cost

### Cost Considerations

When implementing this guidance on AWS, it's important to understand the various factors that contribute to the overall cost. This section outlines the primary cost components and key factors that influence pricing.

### Cost Components

The total cost of running this solution can be broadly categorized into two main components:

1. **LLM Provider Costs**: These are the charges incurred for using services from LLM providers such as Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, Anthropic, and others. Each provider has its own pricing model, typically based on factors like the number of tokens processed, model complexity, and usage volume.

2. **AWS Infrastructure Costs**: These are the costs associated with running the Gen AI Gateway proxy server on AWS infrastructure. This includes various AWS services and resources used to host and operate the solution.

### Key Factors Influencing AWS Infrastructure Costs

While the default configuration provides a starting point, the actual cost of running the LiteLLM-based proxy server on AWS can vary significantly based on your specific implementation and usage patterns. Some of the major factors that can impact scaling and cost include:

1. **Compute Instances**: The type and number of EC2 instances used to host the LiteLLM container as a proxy. Instance type selection affects both performance and cost.

2. **EBS Storage**: The type and size of EBS volumes attached to the EC2 instances can influence both performance and cost.

3. **Autoscaling Configuration**: The autoscaling policies configured for EKS/ECS clusters will affect how the solution scales in response to demand, impacting both performance and cost.

4. **Traffic Patterns**: The shape and distribution of LLM requests, including factors such as:

   - Request/response payload sizes
   - Tokens per minute (TPM)
   - Requests per minute (RPM)
   - Concurrency levels
   - Model latency (from downstream LLM providers)
   - Network latency between AWS and LLM providers

5. **Caching Configuration**: Effective caching can reduce the number of requests to LLM providers, potentially lowering costs but requiring additional resources.

6. **Database Storage**: The amount of storage required for managing virtual keys, organizations, teams, users, budgets, and per-request usage tracking.

7. **High Availability and Resiliency**: Configurations for load balancing, routing, and retries can impact both reliability and cost.

8. **Logging Level**: The configured logging level affects storage and potentially network egress costs.

9. **Networking Costs**: This includes data transfer charges and the cost of running NAT gateways for outgoing calls to LLM providers.

It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list of cost factors, but rather highlights some of the major contributors to the overall cost of the solution.

### Customer Responsibility

While this implementation guide provides default configurations, customers are responsible for:

1. Configuring the solution to their optimal settings based on their specific use case and requirements.
2. Monitoring and managing the costs incurred from running the proxy server on AWS infrastructure.
3. Managing and optimizing the costs associated with their chosen LLM providers.

Customers should regularly review their AWS service usage patterns, adjust configurations as needed, and leverage AWS cost management tools to optimize their spending.

We recommend creating a [budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-create.html) 
through [AWS Cost Explorer](http://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) to
help manage costs. Prices are subject to change and also depend on model provider usage patterns/volume of data. For full details, please refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this guidance.

### Sample Cost tables

The following tables provide a sample cost breakdown for deploying this guidance on ECS and EKS container orchestration platforms with the default parameters in the `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) region for one month. These estimates are based on the AWS Pricing Calculator outputs for the full deployments as per guidance and are subject to changes in underlying services configuration.

## Security

When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your operational burden because AWS operates, manages, and controls the components including the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. For more information about AWS security, visit [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/).

This guidance implements several security best practices and AWS services to enhance the security posture of your ECS and EKS Clusters. Here are the key security components and considerations:

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- **IAM Roles**: The architecture deploys dedicated IAM roles (`litellm-stack-developers`, `litellm-stack-operators`) to manage access to ECS or EKS cluster resources. This follows the principle of least privilege, ensuring users and services have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
- **EKS Managed Node Groups**: These groups use created IAM roles (`litellm-stack-eks-nodegroup-role`) with specific permissions required for nodes to join the cluster and for pods to access AWS services.

### Network Security

- **Amazon VPC**: ECS or EKS clusters are deployed within a VPC (newly created or custom specified in guidance deployment configuration) with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones, providing network isolation.
- **Security Groups**: Security groups are typically used to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances and other resources within the VPC.
- **NAT Gateways**: Deployed in public subnets to allow outbound internet access for resources in private subnets while preventing inbound access from the internet.

### Data Protection

- **Amazon EBS Encryption**: EBS volumes used by EC2 instances for EKS compute nodes are typically encrypted to protect data at rest.
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**: used for managing encryption keys for various services, including EBS volume encryption.
- **AWS Secrets manager**: used for stores external model providers credentials and other sensitive settings securely.

### Kubernetes-specific Security

- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control is implemented within the EKS cluster to manage fine-grained access to Kubernetes resources.
- **AWS Certificate Manager**: Integrated to manage SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication within the clusters.
- **AWS Identity and Access Manager**: used for role/policy based access to AWS services and resources, including ECS or EKS cluster resource access

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Used for monitoring and logging of AWS resources and applications running on the EKS cluster.

### Container Security

- **Amazon ECR**: Stores container images in a secure, encrypted repository. It includes vulnerability scanning to identify security issues in your container images.

### Secrets Management

- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Secrets Manager stores external model provider credentials and other sensitive settings securely.

### Additional Security Considerations

- Regularly update and patch ECS or EKS clusters, compute nodes, and container images.
- Implement network policies to control pod-to-pod communication within the cluster.
- Use Pod Security Policies or Pod Security Standards to enforce security best practices for pods.
- Implement proper logging and auditing mechanisms for both AWS and Kubernetes resources.
- Regularly review and rotate IAM and Kubernetes RBAC permissions.

### Quotas

Service quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum number of service resources or operations for your AWS account.

### Quotas for AWS services in this Guidance

Make sure you have sufficient quota for each of the services implemented in this guidance. For more information, see [AWS service
quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).

To view the service quotas for all AWS services in the documentation without switching pages, view the information in the [Service endpoints and
quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-general.pdf#aws-service-information) page in the PDF format instead.
